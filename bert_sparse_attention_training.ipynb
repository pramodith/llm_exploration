        "# Exploring the affects of custom Sparse Attention\n",
        "In our prior notebook, we found that both encoder-only and decoder-only models offload a significant portion of their attention scores to **sink tokens**. We identified that these sink tokens tend to be either special tokens like **[CLS], [SEP]** or tokens corresponding to **punctuations**. The consistence display of this phenomenon across model architectures and inputs makes one question the relevance of dense self-attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we'll explore the performance of BERT by creating custom attention masks, which will be sparse in nature. We'll create a unique mask per each token, where all tokens attend to special tokens and the k tokens in their neighborhood. When visualized the tokens along a diagonal of size 2*k+1 and the first anad last tokens (in the case of BERT) being attended to. We'll also explore the effects of allowing dense attention in some layers and sparse attention in the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll assess the downstream performance of the models that leverage this type of custom attention mask on some commonly used datasets for benchmarking like [TBD]."
