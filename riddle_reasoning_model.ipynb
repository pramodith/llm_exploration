Let's break down the logic. \\n\\nThe number 13 is significant in a deck of cards as each suit has 13 cards: Ace through 10, and the three picture cards: Jack, Queen, and King. Now, let's think about the 'hearts' part of the question. In a standard deck of cards, there are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. One of these suits is hearts.\\n\\nTherefore, in a deck of cards, there are 13 hearts. However, these hearts do not beat as they are not living, they are simply a suit in a deck of cards. They are symbolic hearts, not biological ones. So, based on this logical deduction, we can conclude that a deck of cards is what has 13 hearts but none that beat. \\n\\nThis type of riddle requires both literal and metaphorical thinking. The number 13 and the word 'hearts' might initially lead one to think of something biological or living because hearts are typically associated with living beings, and the number 13 might make one think of a group of 13 living beings. However, the clue that none of these hearts beat should lead one to think in a more symbolic or metaphorical direction, hence leading to the answer of a deck of cards.\",\n",

       " 'output': [\"The question seems to be a riddle that is focusing on an entity that can evoke a range of emotional responses. The given clues are that it can make someone dream or stamp their feet, and it can also make someone laugh or weep. \\n\\nLet's break down these clues. Dreaming and stamping feet are both reactions that can be associated with feelings of joy, excitement, or anticipation. On the other hand, laughing and weeping are expressions of happiness and sadness respectively. So, we are looking for something that can induce these varied emotional reactions.\\n\\nConsidering these clues, one plausible answer could be 'music'. Here's why: \\n\\nMusic has a profound impact on our emotions. It has the power to uplift our spirits, soothe our nerves, make us feel happy, sad, excited, calm, and even lead us into a state of introspection or dreaming. \\n\\nWhen we listen to upbeat music, it often makes us want to move or dance. Hence, the reference to 'stamp their feet'. In contrast, a soft, melodic tune can make us dreamy or reflective.\\n\\nMusic can also make us laugh or weep. A song with funny lyrics can make us laugh, while a melancholic melody or a song linked to personal memories can bring tears to our eyes.\\n\\nTherefore, considering all the clues in the riddle and the emotional responses they correspond to, 'music' seems to be a fitting answer.\",\n",
       "  'The answer to this riddle is an onion. Let\\'s break it down to understand why.\\n\\nFirstly, the question is clearly a riddle, which is a statement or question or phrase having a double or veiled meaning, put forth as a puzzle to be solved. Riddles often rely on metaphor, simile, and allegory.\\n\\nIn this riddle, the key clues are \"take off my skin\" and \"I won\\'t cry, but you will.\" \\n\\n\"Take off my skin\" implies the subject of the riddle has layers or skin that can be removed. This could apply to many things such as fruits, vegetables, or animals.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t cry, but you will\" is the more specific clue. The phrase \"I won\\'t cry, but you will\" indicates that the act of removing the skin or outer layer from the subject causes the person doing so to cry, but not the subject itself. \\n\\nThe only common item that fits this description is an onion. Onions have a skin that can be peeled off (or \"taken off\"), and a known reaction to cutting or peeling onions is that it causes people\\'s eyes to tear up, or \"cry.\" \\n\\nThe chemicals released from an onion during the peeling or cutting process react with the human eye to produce a stinging sensation, prompting the eyes to produce tears in response. Meanwhile, the onion, being an inanimate object, is incapable of crying.\\n\\nSo, using these clues and a process of logical deduction, we can conclude that the answer to the riddle is an onion.'],\n",

Let\\'s break it down:\\n\\nFirstly, the line \"Drop me and I’m sure to crack\" indicates that the object in question is fragile. When you drop fragile items, they often break or crack. This could apply to many things such as glass, ceramics, eggs, and more. However, to figure out the exact object, we need to consider the second part of the riddle as well.\\n\\nThe second line \"lend me a smile and I’ll certainly smile back\" suggests that the object reflects what is presented in front of it. This reflection is not necessarily physical, but in this case, it is. When you smile at this object, it appears to smile back at you. Not many objects have this reflective quality, which narrows down our options.\\n\\nConsidering both lines of the riddle, the object must be something that is both fragile (can crack when dropped) and reflective (can mimic a smile). The object that fits these characteristics is a mirror. \\n\\nA mirror is fragile and can easily crack or shatter if dropped. Also, a mirror reflects the image in front of it, so if you smile at a mirror, it will \\'smile\\' back. Therefore, the answer to this riddle is a mirror.',\n",
