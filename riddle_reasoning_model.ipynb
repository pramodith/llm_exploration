'cards',\n"," 'output': \"The answer to this question lies in the realm of playing cards. Let's break down the logic. \\n\\nThe number 13 is significant in a deck of cards as each suit has 13 cards: Ace through 10, and the three picture cards: Jack, Queen, and King. Now, let's think about the 'hearts' part of the question. In a standard deck of cards, there are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. One of these suits is hearts.\\n\\nTherefore, in a deck of cards, there are 13 hearts. However, these hearts do not beat as they are not living, they are simply a suit in a deck of cards. They are symbolic hearts, not biological ones. So, based on this logical deduction, we can conclude that a deck of cards is what has 13 hearts but none that beat. \\n\\nThis type of riddle requires both literal and metaphorical thinking. The number 13 and the word 'hearts' might initially lead one to think of something biological or living because hearts are typically associated with living beings, and the number 13 might make one think of a group of 13 living beings. However, the clue that none of these hearts beat should lead one to think in a more symbolic or metaphorical direction, hence leading to the answer of a deck of cards.\",\n"," 'instruction': 'What has 13 hearts but none beat?'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}],"execution_count":5},{"id":"a0acc254","cell_type":"code","source":"# Load and prep dataset\nSYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nRespond in the following format:\n<reasoning>\n...\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n...\n</answer>\n\"\"\"\n\nXML_COT_FORMAT = \"\"\"\\\n<reasoning>\n{reasoning}\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n{answer}\n</answer>\n\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"id":"a0acc254"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":7},{"id":"d20e3b3e","cell_type":"code","source":"reformatted_riddles_dataset = riddles_dataset.map(\n    lambda x: {\n        \"question\": x[\"instruction\"],\n        \"prompt\": [\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": SYSTEM_PROMPT},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": x[\"instruction\"]},\n        ],\n    },\n)","metadata":{"id":"d20e3b3e","outputId":"5a44cb0b-d8bd-4a54-a956-cefdfd1feefb","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":49,"referenced_widgets":["ac869845dd154f06be81ee5360216093","c1b5dec8487c4114b38b2aa4641747e6","4062ca21ca58487191c28982e46d2921","d5cab91b564f4a1e82e23a389b13f62b","c298811cd3af4b6bbcb5a7a895ef39fe","a8ec18338e2e4b0cba4d19a96f09546d","24cc6b4cda81486580814c797d43f56e","a8e967d146814c2dbd7dda6786fe15a1","1ecf193e8a904632a2a422dc751f4aeb","4dca59cf248045eab3c8268d921cd7cc","6137ea418c3542598ce16e0ce9fb9989"]}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Map:   0%|          | 0/469 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"ac869845dd154f06be81ee5360216093"}},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":8},{"id":"VJ5Gu8v23QEf","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Format the dataset to contain a __prompt__ key and an __answer__ key.","metadata":{"id":"VJ5Gu8v23QEf"}},{"id":"0e9d5249","cell_type":"code","source":"def ml_foundations_reformat():\n    reformatted_riddles_dataset = []\n    labels = {}\n    for doc in riddles_dataset[\"train\"]:\n        for choice in doc[\"question\"][\"choices\"]:\n            labels[choice[\"label\"]] = choice[\"text\"]\n\n        answer = labels[doc[\"answerKey\"]]\n        prompt= [\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": SYSTEM_PROMPT},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": doc[\"question\"][\"stem\"]},\n        ]\n        reformatted_riddles_dataset.append({\n            \"question\": doc[\"question\"][\"stem\"],\n            \"prompt\": prompt,\n            \"answer\": answer,\n        })","metadata":{"id":"0e9d5249"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"3f111ce5","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset Filtering","metadata":{"id":"3f111ce5"}},{"id":"b3607f80","cell_type":"code","source":"import litellm\nfrom litellm import batch_completion\nlitellm.num_retries = 2  # Retry 5 times\n\nfrom jinja2 import Environment\n\nenvironment = Environment()\nriddle_quality_system_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are a helpful assistant that evaluates the quality of a riddle.\nYou will be given a question and its answer.

This could apply to many things such as glass, ceramics, eggs, and more. However, to figure out the exact object, we need to consider the second part of the riddle as well.\\n\\nThe second line \"lend me a smile and I’ll certainly smile back\" suggests that the object reflects what is presented in front of it. This reflection is not necessarily physical, but in this case, it is. When you smile at this object, it appears to smile back at you. Not many objects have this reflective quality, which narrows down our options.\\n\\nConsidering both lines of the riddle, the object must be something that is both fragile (can crack when dropped) and reflective (can mimic a smile). The object that fits these characteristics is a mirror. \\n\\nA mirror is fragile and can easily crack or shatter if dropped.
